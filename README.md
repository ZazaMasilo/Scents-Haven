 ## USER EXPERIENCE

**Database Planning**

I used [LucidChart](https://lucid.app/documents#/documents?folder_id=recent) to create my ERD for my database. It is a model with six models: User, Post, Comment, Category,booking and collaboration request.

 ## CREATION PROCESS

  ### Wireframes
  I created the wire frames using Figms. All login and registration forms were created by allauth and as such I haven't provided wire fr

### Mobile

### Ipad and Desktop



## DESIGN
  - **Typography**
    
    [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) I decided to use two different fonts to distinguish between the general site text and the personal blog content. To achieve this, I imported the following font:
    The Playfair Display font was chosen as it is a visually appealing font for a perfume blog and easy to read.
    The Lato font was chosen as it is suitable for both body text and large headings. It would complement the Playfair Display font.S
    
  - **Colour scheme**
    
  ![Colour Pallete](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/895e5188-17ea-4320-8933-65425027cbfa)

        
   Since my blog focuses on the world of perfume, I wanted the color scheme to reflect the elegant and vibrant hues found in the fragrance industry. I opted for strong, primary colors to create a striking contrast against a white background, ensuring that the overall design is impactful. However, I kept the palette limited so that it would not overshadow the beautiful images of perfumes and their intricate bottles, allowing the visuals to take center stage.
    The palette was chosen using [Coolers](https://coolors.co/)
    
  - **Imagery**
    
    The images used in each blog post are from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)

 ## WEBSITE FEATURES
 
   ### Main View

 <img width="277" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/656122c4-3d9f-461c-a233-ab1a7f3f732c" />

  I decided to have users arrive directly on the blog post page rather than requiring them to log in or register before being able to see anything. 
  I felt it would draw people in more and encourage them to then register and get involved.
  There are clear messages to tell the user whether they are logged in or not
  
  ### Signup feature

<img width="898" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2165a9fd-e432-42d8-b422-0af910153300" />

Incorporating a signup feature would not only enhance user engagement but also helps cultivate a loyal readership and grow my blog's reach.

### Booking feature

<img width="652" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4da7b7db-0a60-4eff-aea5-e764c95d60ca" />

<img width="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9ca4fd6-d92f-40d8-9ecd-c15fcbcbb091" />

I decided a  well-designed booking feature would contribute to a seamless user experience, making it easier for visitors to interact with the blog and access the services.

 ## DEPLOYMENT
 The site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows:
 - Install the gunicorn python package and create a file called 'Procfile' in the repo's root directory
 - In the Procfile write 'web: gunicorn scents haven.wsgi'

 - In settings.py add 'https://*.herokuapp.com' to CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS list, git add, commit and push to github

Navigate to the Heroku dashboard
 - Create a new Heroku app
 - Give it a name and select the region 'Europe'
Navigate to settings tab and scroll down to Config Vars
 - Click 'Reveal Config Vars'
 - Add the following keys:
         key = DATABASE_URL | value = (my secret database url)
         key = SECRET_KEY | value = (my secret key)
Navigate to Deploy tab
 - Connect to GitHub and select the repo 'lunar-lists'
 - Scroll down to 'Manual deploy' and select the 'main' branch

 ## TESTING

  ### HTML validation
  I have used the W3C Markup validator to validate all of my HTML code - [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

A different approach was required for validating the HTML for this project as all of the pages are developed using DTL and most require user authentication. The HTML validator will throw errors if I were to use the URL so I have had to follow the below approach for every page:
  - navigate to the deployed Heroku link
  - right click to find the 'view page source' link
  - copy and paste the HTML code from here into the validator via the direct input

![Screenshot 2024-12-12 114704](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d160f1d-bdc5-47e7-919f-a44f4f533047)

All HTML was checked and had no errors or warnings to show as indicated above. 

  ### CSS validation

<img width="920" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbb68fde-1a20-42a1-8f71-ebcf557f39b3" />
[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate my CSS file. 
All CSS checked and had no errors or warnings to show as indicated above.

 ### Javascript validation

  [JavaScript Validator](https://jshint.com) - The JavaScript code passed the validation process without any errors being detected. The use of let and const to define variables and template literals is only available with ES6 was highlighted.

   ### Python validation
[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) was used to validate the python files I created or edited myself.
Initial errors were shown involving indentation and spacing but these were corrected.    

  

## Lighthouse scores via Chrome dev tools

The performance score is low due to image formats. Image formats like WebP and AVIF often provide better compression than PNG or JPEG, which means faster downloads and less data consumption.
