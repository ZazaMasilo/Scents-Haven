 ## USER EXPERIENCE
 ---
**Database Planning**

I used  [LucidChart](https://lucid.app/documents#/documents?folder_id=recent) to create my ERD for my database. It is a simple model with seven models: User, Post, Comment, about,collaboration request, booking and fragrance samples.
The User model was imported from Django Allauth

![ERD](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9710654-9ada-4b5a-991e-cff057cc5210)

**Purpose and Intended Audience**

My intention was to design a website that showcases the amazing world of perfumes and fragrances, highlighting the diverse benefits and uses of different scents. At the same time, I wanted to create a space where fragrance enthusiasts could visit and feel involved by sharing their own experiences, tips, and insights about perfumes. The website allows me to present various aspects of perfumery, from the mood-enhancing properties of certain scents and how they can be used to enhance daily life, special occasions, or even as a form of self-expression.

I used [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/ZazaMasilo/projects/6) to create my project board and populated it with my user stories and added labels according to MoSCoW prioritisation.
All of the 'must have' user stories were completed with any other issues being carried over to the next phase of the project development.
Each user story had acceptance criteria added. The key user stories and acceptance criteria are listed below with evidence of how I completed each issue:

![User story 7- Manage blog posts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52046474-be19-446a-a1b7-85e052dd39df)
Acceptance criteria:
Site admin can log in
Once logged in can create a post
The fulfillment of these criteria can be demonstrated by the presence of blog posts on the site


![user-story-6 - Modify or delete comment on a post](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bed806bc-fbe3-485c-896b-98c0e71a7be0)
Acceptance criteria:
As a logged in user their comments are available to edit/delete - this was set up to display CRUD functionality and tested extensively during development. 
	 

![user-story-5 - Comment on a post](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/644afa62-84d3-47bb-8a2a-09a10baeb274)
Acceptance criteria:
The user can log in and create comments
If there is more than one comment then there is a conversation thread
This user story also contributed towards the CRUD functionality and was tested throughout every phase of the project development

## CREATION PROCESS

  ### Wireframes
  I only created wire frames for the pages I intended to create myself. All login and registration forms were created by allauth and as such I haven't provided wire frames.

![Figma wireframe](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7b384cb-00bb-42fa-83ee-93c3182fffe7)

## DESIGN
  - **Typography**
    
    [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to choose the font used. I had the idea that I wanted two fonts to 
   differentiate the general site text from the personal blog text so the following font was imported:
    
    The Gloria Hallelujah font was chosen for the blog introduction and the blog entries themselves as it resembles 
    handwritten text and I felt it would lend a more personal touch to the blog. I wanted it to feel as though the user was 
    reading my diary entries directly.
    
  - **Colour scheme**
    
  ![colour-scheme](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00aa9746-14ed-425e-979c-1dee50ba4843)

        
    As the blog is about nature and wildlife I wanted the colour scheme to reflect the colours I have in my garden. I wanted 
    strong, primary colours for impact as they would be against a white background, but didn't want a large palette as I 
    included lots of images of wildlife that I didn't want to detract from. 
    The palette was chosen using [Coolers](https://coolors.co/)
    
  - **Imagery**
    
    The majority of the images used in each blog post are my own images taken of my garden and I was really proud to be able 
    to use them. I had a lot of fun creating posts and uploading images. Seeing the finished article on the screen gave 
    me enormous pleasure despite the fact that the load time for my site was compromised.
    Two of the images were royalty-free stock images from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) Acknowledgements for the 
    individual photographers are in the [credits](#credits) section.

## WEBSITE FEATURES


  **MAIN VIEW**
  <details open>
  <summary>landing page</summary
  ![home-page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72eefb0f-81d3-41d5-b856-bfa8198ccf6b)


  </details>
  I decided to have users arrive directly on the blog post page rather than requiring them to log in or register before being able to see anything. 
  I felt it would draw people in more and encourage them to then register and get involved.
  There are clear messages to tell the user whether they are logged in or not

<br>
    
  **BLOG POST DETAIL VIEW**
  <details>
  <summary>The detailed view of each </summary>
					     
  ![post-detail](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03b2cda8-1505-4bd3-9fe2-8fcd2cf7ca2d)

  
  </details>
  Each blog post is shown with the image and the detail of the post in a font I chose to make it appear as though it was an entry in a diary. 

  <br>

  **COMMENT FEATURE**
  <details>
  <summary>Comment box</summary>
  ![comment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdf67ea2-1fad-410c-91e2-659a28432bde)

	  
  </details>
  Each blog post gives the user the option to add comments. They can also edit/delete commemts they have previously made. The 
 comments then appear colour coded so that the user can tell which have been approved by admin.


  **SOCIAL LINKS FEATURE**


 ![footer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57a79318-bd2f-423e-b015-3f59dea69dce)



  The footer gives links to social sites and GitHub. The colour was chosen to match the header and fit in with the overall 
  colour scheme.




 ---

## FUTURE FEATURES
The following would be options to consider including in future versions of the website:
  - an about page for information about the developer
    
  - an option for users to create their own blog posts
    
  - a way for users to take part in some citizen science where they can document species they have seen in their gardens

  - a booking site where users can book nature activities

  - a gallery page of users pictures

## TESTING

  ### HTML validation

I have used the W3C Markup validator to validate all of my HTML code - [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

A different approach was required for validating the HTML for this project as all of the pages are developed using DTL and most require user authentication. The HTML validator will throw errors if I were to use the URL so I have had to follow the below approach for every page:
  - navigate to the deployed Heroku link
  - right click to find the 'view page source' link
  - copy and paste the HTML code from here into the validator via the direct input

[home page html validation](readme.docs/home-page-html.png)

All HTML was checked and had no errors or warnings to show as indicated above. 
The home page had an initial error where I had nested a <p> within a <span> but I corrected this and commited the code and the validation was clear.

   ### CSS validation

[CSS validation](readme.docs/css-validation.png)
[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate my CSS file. External CSS for Bootstrap, provided by [CDN](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.2.3/css/bootstrap.min.css) was not tested.

   ### Javascript validation

  [JavaScript Validator](https://jshint.com) - the JavaScript validation did not throw up and issues. The fact that the use of let and const to define variables and template literals is only available with ES6 was highlighted.

   ### Python validation
[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) was used to validate the python files I created or edited myself.
Initial errors were thrown up involving line length of comments and spacing but these were corrected.    

  

## Lighthouse scores via Chrome dev tools 
![lighthouse](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad97e67e-3d28-4c94-a847-d2c011aeac67)

The performance score is low due to the amount of images used but all the images have been compressed.

  

### Accessibility     

The site was tested via WAVE the web accessibility evaluation tool and showed some alerts for contrast between the text and the background colour.
The first was for the message warning a user they are not logged in, which had white text against a bright red. The colour of the background was muted and checked via [Contrast Finder](https://app.contrast-finder.org/?lang=en) which showed excellent contrast. 
There was also a contrast issue between the white text and the orange background in the navbar and footer but I felt this was not enough of an issue to change the appearance and style of the whole site.


<br>


### Issues/Bugs
  
  - On the blog post detail page the image is only showing the top part
  - The images on the main page are very large and not a uniform shape....I decided I like being able to see the full image rather than limiting how much to see and I like
    the fact that everything isn't uniform but that might just be me!
 - there are too many to list in all honesty, so apologies, but I didn't have the ability or confidence to be able to sort everything out in this version of the project...hopefully I 
   will have more luck with a resubmission...I will be less stressed  and have time to learn Django more


### Agile Process
I made an attemtpt to follow an agile process. I had a project board in github which I updated with my user stories. Each user story was labelled according to MoSCoW prioritisation and had acceptance criteria. If I'm honest I didn't then keep the board up to date as I should have as I was so focused on the minutiae of the project and the stress of not thinking I would be able to actually produce anything that the board was the last priority. I have updated it since drawing a line under my development for now and many of the user stories have been moved into the finished section. There are several still in the backlog which have been added to my future features.
I have learned a lot for the future about planning and a large part of that is using the project board more and following an agile process more closely to keep myself on track.
